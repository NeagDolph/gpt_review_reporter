    "Something you would find in a dollar store.",
    "One of the earrings came broken. I super glued it and will see how that holds up.",
    "It is pretty but when I removed it from the box, one of the lotus branches was broken. I don‚Äôt know if they shipped it to me despite the broken item or if it was broken during shipment. I can‚Äôt believe I paid $30 for this broken item.",
    "Like other review the earring arrived separated. I chose to return not replace because I was afraid it would happen to another pair while wearing.",
    "Came brokenüò†",
    "I thought it was silver but it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs not a hypo allergenic metal either. Anyway it‚Äôs cheap and it‚Äôs not worth it.",
    " Review Arrived broken Request the removal, ",
    "Color not close to images",
    "I ordered a spinner ring. The rings spinner cracked within a few months of owning it. I ordered a 2nd ring to replace it, I was past the 30 day return policy. This rings spinner also cracked & broke in few months. I called to company in hopes, as a small business, they would stand by their product. Too much disappointment, they said there was nothing they could do, and I was out of luck. The rings are clearly not well made, and the company offered no solution. So much for shopping and supporting a small business.",

    "Beautiful but The ring is not true size",
    "It's really cute but the size they sent was wrong",
    "The Ring arrived bent as it would only spin approximately halfway before getting caught up on itsself. I considered keeping it anyway but the original picture showed the hearts as filled in with a black sandblasted look and this ring the hearts were flat silver and not very deep so there was no texture to give any friction that could maybe add a little help when it got caught up.",
    "This was the worst purchase I ever made off of Amazon. The ring arrived on time but when it was taken out of the box and tried on it broke. It is supposed to spin but broke immediately after trying out what it is supposed to do. Sent this back for a replacement and the same thing happened whrn it arrived. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT. Horrible craftsmanship. Better quality at the dollar store.",
    "Horrible,I think from the video I posted everyone can agree, this ring they sent is nothing like the ones they have in the picture. It's used, old, damaged, stained. I'm very disappointed.",
    "bought two both fell apart and customer service sucks",
    "Got an old tarnished, well worn ring prob older than me",
    "Item is very cheap looking. Like maybe $10.00. Certainly not $32.00.",
    "While this is a very beautiful set, I have to take off points because of how I received it. The jewelry box it came in was worn looking. Upon opening the jewelry box, a strong order of perfume was on the neckless. It was clearly used and returned. I bought this as a Christmas gift and was told a replacement wouldn't come until after. Very disappointed!",
    "one earring came broken at the coral ring part. It looks that there are so fragile that I don't want the replacement, just the refund, and the answer was I can't get one",
    "The product is so cheap and not worth sending back because of the cost to do so I feel tricked",
    "It was broken upon delivery. Not only was the compass broken but the box was poorly made and barley opened. Extremely disappointed",
    "Ordered black for my mothers birthday. The one she received is more browns and golds. She loves it so I won‚Äôt be returning, just disappointed not correct color.Quality seems good but not worn for any length of time.",
    "I opened the bag and beads flew all over my living room! I don't have the patience to put a necklace together so I'm sending it all back.",
    "I bought this tank on Amazon back in early Oct as a Christmas gift, I contacted Amazon for the sellers info because they had a 6 month warranty with their item. They refused to help me because I did not purchase directly from them that I needed to contact Amazon So I got back on with Amazon costumer support an they offered me a refund even with it being WAY out of return time. The Tank is dangerously light weight can tip over easy, it doesn't have a shut off switch it has to be unplugged to turn it off. An the fish don't float (in mine) it's over priced for the quality an the costumer service from the actual seller. I give it one star only because I have to üò†",
    "I got the ring in the wrong size it was supposed to be a 8 and it was a 6 so I thought I made a mistake but when I went back to order another on the billing said 6 when you have it in all sizes so you can only get it in a size 6 but it say 4 through 10 so I'm very. disappointed my husband got it for our anniversary so no stars for these i have no way to get it sized I don't owe a car at this time very upset",
    "Notified the customer service on the packaging that came with the jewelry. No help. Not at all happy with the purchase.",
    "Advertized at .925 but it is Electrico plated. Looks beautiful until you get close to it. There are gaps in the design, ares of extremely thin plating, burrs and drips mar the ring. After a month, the plating wore off in several spots. If the garnets test real, I will take to a local jeweler for reset in a true silver ring.",
    "Jewelry was fine. It arrived the day after the holiday. It was supposed to arrive 4/7, holiday 4/9, jewelry arrived 4/10. Dissappointed.",
    "Cheap imitation wrong color, plastic!",
    "Naw Pass",
    "The whole point of the spinner is to collect it with the needle.",
    "Says 925 platinum plated on the description, however it‚Äôs very dainty and says stainless steel on the bracelet. Very disappointing for the price nothing but dark over shiny and very poorly made without authentic detail. Nothing but metal just for a buck you could buy it. Sterling silver is 20$ That their advertising. This is only dark rhodium metal. Don‚Äôt buy it.",
    "I loved these earrings. They're pretty, lightweight, and comfortable. I put them on for the third time, and one of the earrings broke off from the fixture. I have stored them and treated them carefully, which tells me these are not well made. So disappointed.",
    "The light is super bright and the bubbles are nice, my complaint is that it constantly cycles through the light colors and you have no control over it. I know that's how it's advertised, but still, it's annoying. Doesn't make a good night light",
    "It didn't say I had to get distilled water and put it together myself. But it's still cool",
    "Ordered this ring, twice. Both time the ring was missing from the package. I ordered for a friend that I thought would really benefit from it. Do not recommend.",
    "You have to really work at getting this ring to spin. Not at all what expected.",
    "This was a gift for my daughter. She loved it at first. In 2 weeks of wearing the ring, the silver plating started wearing off. She wasn‚Äôt being hard on it, just normal wear.\nI‚Äôm sending it back.",
    "Ordered this ring, twice. Both time the ring was missing from the package. I ordered for a friend that I thought would really benefit from it. Do not recommend.",
    "Spins and fits I even ordered my actual size before reading the size runs small thing so for me at least the ring fits correctly. I did just see comments on fingers turning green and I‚Äôll be pretty upset if that happens considering what I payed for this ‚Äústarling silver‚Äù ring. Update yep finger is green",
    "I really loved the design of the ring. I wished that it had come in half sizes (9.5) instead of a 9. The 9 was a little tight. Unfortunately, it broke pretty easily after a couple days of wearing it when I was spinning it.",
    "Bought this product in my normal size to fit my pointer finger. I would say it‚Äôs about 2 sizes 2 small. SIZE UP",
    "Too small even in one size larger. The stars and dots and moons are not black like it shows in the pic. The part that makes it spin is also not black like it shows. It also has a terrible spin to it.",
    "I had one of these and loved it, but lost it at the airport. I got the exact one again, and it doesn't spin, which is the whole point.",
    " Had it on since last night and has turned my finger green. This is suppose to be sterling silver and its not. I want my money back.",
    "The ring was definitely not worth the money. The spinner part of the ring broke less then a week after receiving the product.",
    "The product broke the first day I got it because I dropped it once and it was done for.",
    "Horrible quality middle piece Is separate from the ring once I washed my hands the middle piece spun around so the ring rattles.",
    "doesn't spin freely",
    "This ring worked fine and looks great out of the box.\n\nAfter 1 day of normal wear the ring no longer spins more than a quarter turn. The silver is soft enough that your body heat and any amount of pressure warps the inner or outer ring and effects the ability to spin.\n\nLooks great, my wife thought is was wonderful‚Ä¶ until it wasn‚Äôt the next day.",
    "I was disappointed with the design stamped on the ring. As you can see from my photo, the little dots are as large as the stars and moon. It their photo, it was much more delicate- which allowed the stars and moons to stand out a bit. It honestly looks like random dots all the way around.",
    "it‚Äôs cute & the spinning aspect of it is great but that‚Äô s when the ring itself isn‚Äôt warping - it‚Äôs warped so many times , when it happens you can‚Äôt spin it anymore let alone put it on your finger .",
    "Does not spin very much at all. Barely moves. I wanted to return it but missed the window.\nLack of spinning causes more anxiety than it is supposed to relieve.",
    "Super disappointed with this. I was so excited to get it and put it on immediately. I've worn it every day for over a week and today it broke. The spinner broke right in half. For the money I spent, I figured this would have lasted quite a bit longer when I've bought ones for much cheaper years ago that are still intact.",
    "So the ring looks really nice, and is comfortable to wear. My reason for giving it a 2 is because it doesn't spin well. The part that spins keeps sticking. I bought this to break my habit of picking at my fingers so it not spinning well doesn't serve my purpose.",
    "I ordered the bottom ring and returned it because it was snug. I usually wear a 6 and it will be slightly loose. The 6 I received was too tight and I sent it back. I ordered a size 7 and it fit fine, but it was the wrong ring. I received a replacement and loved it. My daughter and my nieces are also fidgeters and loved the ring. I ordered one for each of them. Unfortunately, I received the wrong ring several times. As you can see in the photo, the one on the bottom is the one I should have gotten. The other three were sent in separate boxes with the same serial number. I sent them back and received one ring which was the wrong ring and two of the other rings were the wrong size, but were labelled with the correct size. Quality control is on permanent holiday at this company. If you can get the right ring in the right size, it is nice. Hopefully it spins freely too! Some of them didn't spin well at all and it was work to get them to move. It should not be work to get a fidget spinner to move. One hand should be mindlessly spinning the ring while the other hand is focusing on the work that you're trying to focus on. That's the ideal for all ADHD fidgets in the end, isn't it?",
    "It was not the size ‚Äú7‚Äù used by jewelry stores too small. Nice ring but I had to return it.",
    "It‚Äôs not silver like in the photos. Also runs small by a 1/2 size.",
    "My ring broke but I did wear it a lot I just expected it to hold up better",
    " The ring looks beautiful and was delivered very quickly. Fits greats and has the 925 stamp inside the ring. Downside: it sticks! The whole idea was so I could spin the ring using one other finger, and it starts to. I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs a slight defect that‚Äôs is not allowing this to spin without some difficulty. Rather annoying for an anxiety spinning ring‚Ä¶.",
    " I‚Äôm going to return it since it was so expensive, especially for it to be misprinted. But I can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs a misprint or just bad quality, I should have read all these reviews first that also had ‚Äúmisprints.‚Äù I wouldn‚Äôt waste your money or time trying this ring and hoping you get one decent looking. I‚Äôm going to go get one for under $10 instead"
