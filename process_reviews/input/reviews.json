This rings spinner also cracked & broke in few months. I called to company in hopes, as a small business, they would stand by their product. Too much disappointment, they said there was nothing they could do, and I was out of luck. The rings are clearly not well made, and the company offered no solution. So much for shopping and supporting a small business."

The Tank is dangerously light weight can tip over easy, it doesn't have a shut off switch it has to be unplugged to turn it off. An the fish don't float (in mine) it's over priced for the quality an the costumer service from the actual seller. I give it one star only because I have to \ud83d\ude20"

I ordered a size 7 and it fit fine, but it was the wrong ring. I received a replacement and loved it. My daughter and my nieces are also fidgeters and loved the ring. I ordered one for each of them. Unfortunately, I received the wrong ring several times. As you can see in the photo, the one on the bottom is the one I should have gotten. The other three were sent in separate boxes with the same serial number. I sent them back and received one ring which was the wrong ring and two of the other rings were the wrong size, but were labelled with the correct size. Quality control is on permanent holiday at this company. If you can get the right ring in the right size, it is nice. Hopefully it spins freely too! Some of them didn't spin well at all and it was work to get them to move. It should not be work to get a fidget spinner to move. One hand should be mindlessly spinning the ring while the other hand is focusing on the work that you're trying to focus on. That's the ideal for all ADHD fidgets in the end, isn't it?"
