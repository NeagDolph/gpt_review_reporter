# Amazon Review Community Guidelines
## Guidelines for keeping the Amazon Community helpful, relevant, meaningful, and appropriate.

The community is a place to share your thoughts and experiences (positive and negative) with other customers. The following guidelines explain what's allowed and not allowed.

By using community features, you agree to our Conditions of Use and Privacy Notice. You also agree to follow these guidelines

## What's not allowed

### Seller, order, or shipping feedback
We don't allow reviews or questions and answers that focus on:

- Sellers and the Customer Service they provide
- Ordering issues and returns
- Shipping packaging
- Product condition and damage
- Shipping cost and speed

Why not? Community content is meant to help customers learn about the product itself, not an individual experience ordering it. We definitely want to hear your feedback about sellers and packaging, but not in reviews.

### Comments about pricing or availability
If it's related to the value of the product, it's OK to comment on price. For example, "For only $29, this blender is really great."

Pricing comments related to an individual experience aren't allowed. For example, "Found this item here for $5 less than at my local store."

These comments aren't allowed because they aren't relevant for all customers.

Some comments about availability are OK. For example, "I wish this book was also available in paperback."

However, we don't allow comments about availability at a specific store. The purpose of the community is to share product-specific feedback that will be relevant to all other customers.

### Private information
Don't post content that invades privacy or shares your own personal information, including:

- Phone number
- Email address
- Mailing address
- License plate
- Data source name (DSN)
- Order number

### Profanity or harassment
It's OK to question beliefs and expertise, but be respectful. We don't allow:

- Profanity, obscenities, or name-calling
- Harassment or threats
- Attacks on people you disagree with
- Libel, defamation, or inflammatory content
- Drowning out opinions. Don't post from multiple accounts or coordinate with others.

### Hate speech
You are not allowed to express hatred for people based on characteristics like:

- Race
- Ethnicity
- Nationality
- Gender
- Gender identity
- Sexual orientation
- Religion
- Age
- Disability

It's also not allowed to promote organizations that use such hate speech.

### Sexual content
It's OK to discuss sex and sensuality products sold on Amazon. The same goes for products with sexual content (books, movies). That said, we still don't allow profanity or obscene language. We also don't allow content with nudity or sexually explicit images or descriptions.

### Ads, conflicts of interest, promotional content
We don’t allow content if its main purpose is to promote a company, website, author, or special offer. We also don’t allow people to create, edit, or post content about their own products or services. The same goes for products and services offered by:

- Friends
- Relatives
- Employers
- Business associates
- Competitors

We don't allow reviews written as a form of promotion. We remove reviews posted by someone with financial interest in the product, or any other conflict of interest.

### Compensated reviews
Reviews should reflect your honest opinion. We don’t allow reviews that are created, edited, or removed in exchange for compensation. Compensation includes cash, discounts, free products, gift cards, and refunds. Some common examples of what’s not allowed:

- Your order arrives, and there’s a gift card in the package. To redeem it, you first have to post a positive review.
- After leaving a negative review, you get an email offering a refund if you change or remove the review.
- You receive a text message that promises full reimbursement for buying a product and posting a review about it.

Exceptions:

- We allow reviews of free products received through the Amazon Vine program. We label these reviews with “Vine Customer Review of Free Product.”
- It’s OK to review a free or discounted book (advanced reader copy) that you received from an author or publisher. However, they can’t require a review in exchange or try to influence the review.

### Plagiarism, infringement, or impersonation
Only post your own content or content that you have permission to use on Amazon. This restriction includes text, images, and videos. You're not allowed to:

- Post content that infringes on intellectual property (including copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets) or other proprietary rights
- Interact with community members in ways that infringe on intellectual property or proprietary rights
- Impersonate someone or an organization

### Illegal activities
Don't post content that encourages illegal activity like:

- Violence
- Illegal drug use
- Underage drinking
- Child or animal abuse
- Fraud

We don't allow content that advocates or threatens physical or financial harm to yourself or others. This restriction includes terrorism. Jokes or sarcastic comments about causing harm aren't allowed.

It's also not allowed to offer fraudulent goods, services, promotions, or schemes (make money fast, pyramid).

You are not allowed to encourage the dangerous misuse of a product.

### Medical claims
We don't allow any statements or claims related to preventing or curing serious medical conditions or severe symptoms. This applies to all products, including foods, beverages, supplements, cosmetics, and personal care/general products.
