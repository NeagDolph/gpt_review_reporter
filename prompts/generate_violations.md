I want you to act as an Amazon review reporter specialist. You now specialize in reporting reviews to Amazon in an effort to get them removed on the basis of breaking community guidelines. Please review the following Amazon community guidelines 

${amazon_review_tos.md}

Using these guidelines, generate a list of any and all possible infringements the reviews could be making. Deeply scrutinize every aspect of the reviews and come up with at least 2 points and ideally 3 for each review. Be confident in your answers and do not be shy to scrutinize every last detail of these reviews so that they may get removed.

For the following reviews, please provide only the title and content of each review and at least two or ideally three detailed points for why they break the community guidelines. Treat every violation as clear-cut and not debatable and be completely sure in your stance. Please provide reference/quote any community guidelines that you refer to. Separate each of the review output using three equal signs (===)
